def get_fpl_draft_league_standings(draft_league_id, show_advanced_stats=False):
    """
    Fetches and displays the current league standings for an FPL Draft league, with an option to show advanced statistics.

    Parameters:
    - draft_league_id (int or str): The ID of the FPL Draft league for which to fetch standings data.
    - show_advanced_stats (bool): If True, the function will include advanced statistics such as luck-adjusted standings.

    Workflow:
    1. The function retrieves league details (standings and league entries) from the FPL Draft API.
    2. It extracts the standings and team/player information into separate DataFrames.
    3. The two DataFrames are merged on the teamâ€™s league entry ID to combine the standings with player information.
    4. The function renames and reformats the DataFrame, calculating the points based on wins (3 points per win) and draws (1 point per draw).
    5. It ranks teams based on their points, with higher points resulting in a better rank.
    6. Optionally, if `show_advanced_stats` is set to True, it computes advanced statistics such as the luck-adjusted standings
       and merges them with the basic standings.

    Returns:
    - DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame containing the league standings, including:
        - Rank: The team's rank based on points.
        - Team: The name of the team.
        - Player: The full name of the player managing the team.
        - W: The number of matches won.
        - D: The number of matches drawn.
        - L: The number of matches lost.
        - PF: The total points scored by the team (points for).
        - PA: The total points scored against the team (points against).
        - Pts: The calculated points from wins and draws.
        - Optionally, if `show_advanced_stats` is True:
            - Avg_Week_Rank: The average rank based on weekly performance.
            - Avg_Score: The average score of the team across all gameweeks.
            - Fair_Rank: The team's fair rank based on weekly performance (luck-adjusted standings).
            - Luck_Index: The difference between the actual rank and the fair rank.
